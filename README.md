## Important Note

- If you are setting up your slack commands by relying on `http://cowboy-slack.herokuapp.com` server, then FYI, I am using Heroku's free dyno, which goes asleep after 20 minutes of inactivity. So if a command doesn't work for your first time, try it again after 5 seconds, as server would be awaken and wouldn't respond and that initial request times out, but subsequent requests will work quickly without a retry.
- A free Heroku dyno could stay awake for 18 hours a day -- if this limit gets exceeded, Heroku shuts that dyno for 6 hours to recharge it. In such a case the server won't be able to respond any request for 6 hours.
- If you want these commands respond all the time consistently, setup cowboy on your own premium server, follow next section on howto.

## Wanna hack?

Follow [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-go) tutorial to setup this project locally, and optionally deploy it on Heroku. This project uses `foreman` utility to spin up/off server, `Godeps` to manage third-party libraries.
